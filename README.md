<h1>Dealer SQL Project</h1>

<p>First, we will brainstorm some ideas.
    We have the following specifications so far...</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Use PDF with an ERD</code></li>
    <li><code>The ERD in PDF</code></li>
    <li><code>SQL code that would be used to create the new database (DDL, DML).</code></li>
    <li><code>Also, once the database and the tables are created, each person should have AT LEAST 2 pieces
            records of data inside of the tables. (You can add more if you want)</code></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So far we know we need three files: <code>ERD</code>, <code>DDL</code>, and <code>DML</code>.</p>

<h2>Week 4 - ERD Assignment</h2>

<h4><i>USE ERD to Create SQL Database</i></h4>

<blockquote>
 <header>Instructions: <hr></header>
Create an ERD for a car dealership. The dealership sells both new and used cars,
and it operates a service facility.<br>
Base your design on the following business rules:
</blockquote>
By the previous approach im thinking in a single table for `<car table>` since in one column you can filter from new to old.
having two table here for each condition of new vs old is useless because you would extend the piece of code to join this tables
<blockquote>

### Lets think about this very quick

> In the world of data and SQL, bytes are like speed enhancers. When creating tables, we're like puzzle solvers,
> fitting data into compact capsules (1 to 4 bytes). Our goal? Super efficiency!
>
> Think big ‚Äì even though we're handling a hundred lines now, reality involves millions or billions of data pieces
> daily. Writing massive code? It's like slowing down a Ferrari from 1ms to 2s.
>
> So, we're the data tailors, crafting sleek bytes for lightning-fast operations. Efficiency is our game, whether it's a
> hundred lines or a million pieces. üöÄüîç
</blockquote>

<p>So far i can see three department</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>staff</li
<li>customer</li
</ul>

After the tables have been created, use SQL to add data to the database

Each person will need to create their own SQL database.
